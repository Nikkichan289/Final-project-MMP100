    <h1>Click on Sara to start</h1>
    <h2>By Nicole Quiles</h2>
    <p> This is about a young kitten named Sara who is being bullied by a mouse. I made this because no matter what age you are you can be targeted for bullying. Young children and teens everyday commonly suffer from depression that could lead to ending their lives but there's always someone to help you through tough times with open arms.</p>
